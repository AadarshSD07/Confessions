# 📱 Confessions — Full-Stack Social Media Platform

**Confessions** is a full-stack basic social media application built with a **Django REST backend** and **React frontend**, featuring **JWT authentication**, **Google OAuth2 login**, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, **Cloudinary image storage**, and **light/dark theme support**.

The application is fully containerized using **Docker** and deployed using **Render (backend & database)** and **Vercel (frontend)**.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Frontend (Vercel): [https://theconfessions.vercel.app/](https://theconfessions.vercel.app/)
Backend API (Render): Hosted on Render (private API)

## 🧩 Architecture Overview
```
React (Vercel)
↓
Django REST API (Render)
↓
PostgreSQL (Render)
↓
Cloudinary (Media Storage)
```

- Frontend and backend are **fully decoupled**
- **Stateless backend** using JWT authentication
- Externalized media storage for scalability
- Cloud-based deployment with containerization

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- **Google OAuth2 login support**
- Secure access & refresh token flow
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - **User**: Standard user with basic permissions
  - **Admin**: Elevated permissions for content moderation

## 🔁 Forgot Password & Secure Password Reset
The application supports a **secure email-based password reset flow**, similar to real-world production systems.

### 🔄 Password Reset Flow
```
User clicks "Forgot Password"
↓
User submits registered email
↓
Backend generates UID + secure reset token
↓
Password reset link emailed to user
↓
User sets a new password via frontend
↓
Password updated securely in backend
```

### 🔐 Security Considerations
- Token-based, time-limited reset links
- Tokens are generated and validated **only on the backend**
- Passwords are hashed using Django’s built-in security mechanisms
- Prevents token forgery and reuse

## 📧 Email Service (Gmail App Password)
Password reset emails are sent using **Gmail SMTP with App Passwords**, ensuring secure email delivery without exposing account credentials.

### 🔑 Gmail App Password Setup
- App passwords are generated from:
```
Google Account → Security → App Passwords
```
- Requires **2-Step Verification**
- App password acts as the SMTP credential (not the Gmail password)

### 🔐 Required Environment Variables
```bash
EMAIL_BACKEND="django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True

EMAIL_HOST_USER="admin_email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD="google_app_password"
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL="Confessions <admin_email@gmail.com>"
```

## 🔑 Google OAuth2 Authentication
Users can sign in using their Google accounts for a frictionless onboarding experience.

### 🧭 OAuth Flow
```
Google ID Token
↓
Django Backend
↓
JWT Access + Refresh Tokens
↓
Stored in localStorage
↓
User Redirected to Dashboard
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow 
1. User logs in with credentials
2. Backend returns JWT access & refresh tokens
3. Frontend stores tokens securely
4. Access token is attached to protected API requests
5. Refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when expired

### 🛠️ Google OAuth2 Setup (Required)

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Create a **New Project**

3. Navigate to:
APIs & Services → OAuth Consent Screen

- Choose **External**
- Fill basic app information
- Add scopes: `email`, `profile`

4. Create OAuth Credentials:
APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID

- Application type: **Web Application**
- Authorized origins:
  ```
  http://localhost:5173
  https://theconfessions.vercel.app
  ```
- Authorized redirect URIs (if applicable)

5. Copy the **Client ID**

### 🔐 Required Environment Variable

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
```

This Client ID is:
- Used in the React frontend for Google login
- Verified by Django backend before issuing JWT tokens

### 👤 User Capabilities
